# Mekastra

⚠️Description from Modpack on Curseforge⚠️

Description
-
This modpack was mainly inspired by : Prominence II and Create. If you like mods like Mekanism, Create, Ad Astra or AE2, we're sure you'll love it.
The modpack is far from complete, lacking quests and descriptions (among other things).
We hope this modpack will give you a new experience with the Tech and Sciences modpacks.
New mods will be added as updates become available.

✔️An official resource pack for the modpack (GUI) made by Suikit
